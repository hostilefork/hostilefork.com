    {If you're not familiar with the open source movement, you might not know what a **"[hostile fork](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?HostileFork)"** is.  It's what happens when someone isn't happy about the way a collaborative effort is being run, so they start their own competing project taking the work of the group in a different direction, rather than working on achieving a consensus.}

    {Hostile Forks didn't happen all that frequently in the past.  People didn't typically work together without some kind of arrangement establishing who owns the rights to work being done.  So breaking off meant starting from scratch—a difficult proposition!  It certainly happened, but people were likely to think twice before duplicating the effort.}

    {In the digital era, the climate is changing—and software is making it possible to share powerful tools with each other.  We can exchange documents without printing so much as a single sheet of paper.  A lot more things can be given away for free (some cases legally, and others illegally).  Though traditional businesses are trying to ramp up the litigation, a counterculture has sprung up that is literally handing out the products of untold hours of work without charge.}

    {Possibly the most prominent efforts are the [Free Software Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation) and the [Wikimedia Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation)--which manages [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org).  Yet there are countless individuals striving toward these goals in one way or another—from tool developers to every blogger who makes their thoughts available on the web!!}

    {These new attitudes are great, but aren't necessarily backed by the spirit of **cooperation**.  While feverishly working to generate great free things to give the world, few are actually researching how their efforts might be surpassed by another option.  And with so much priority placed on plowing ahead with innovation—there's generally just not the time to spend bringing people into the fold and figuring out how an optimal solution can be reached that integrates the best of everyone's efforts.}

    {I believe almost everyone wants to bring about the world where people never have to waste their time on a redundant effort (unless they really want to).  A lot of people running commercial projects—working in isolation—would **rather** have more people able to enjoy the products of their work, and participate in the creation.  But they want respect, need money, and can't feasibly do it.  Or *could they* if someone were actively looking to untangle the dependencies...proactively sticking their fork in the business of others??}

    {That's a huge question, and many think that human nature and the [essential complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_complexity) of the world's problems are too much of a blockade to make this ever happen.  But the HostileFork.com mission is to actually catalog divergent efforts, and orchestrate interventions to properly moderate the personalities and needs of the people who are working in those projects.  Perhaps bringing the right people together to get the right}

    {The Free Software Foundation gets involved in this kind of moderation, but only when it's "important"--like the split between [KDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE) and [GNOME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME).  Nobody is watching out for smaller cases, and I'd like to see the global community start outreaching--without even being asked--to see how they can help improve things.  To do so requires databases for tracking the projects, setting up academic sandboxes where learning exercises aren't mistaken for production code, and building tools to help warn a hapless user when they're on an outmoded project.}

    {We are experimenting with using [Trello](http://trello.com) in order to build working groups to look into redundant efforts and plan forward paths.  This is a project that has been long in the planning, but only as of 2014 really coming online.  Join us!}
