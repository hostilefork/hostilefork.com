    {In my post about [switching over to VirtualBox from VMWare](http://blog.hostilefork.com/virtual-machines-genuine-windows/), I talked about the importance of paring down one's dependence on proprietary software.  That's especially true of software that is antagonistic to what *should* be its purpose: to serve your needs and make your life better.  This is why I keep pushing the envelope such that an increasing amount of my time is spent working in Linux-based virtual machines.}

    {But I also mentioned that I am guilty, guilty, guilty.  I still use the OS/X or Windows included with computers I buy as the "host" operating system.  That's because running Linux will make the people at the Apple store throw up their hands--if a line of pixels in your display goes bad, they'll probably try and tell you it's your fault.  Booting from Linux instantly turns you into a second-class citizen in the eyes of almost any other vendor for driver and software support, which is a bummer if you use your machine for anything interesting (like Graphics/Audio/Video production).}

    {So I usually will only wipe a machine and make it boot directly into Linux when a computer is at the age a vendor won't be supporting it anymore anyway.  Yet terribly enough for our pocketbooks, our sanity, and our environment: now the market has allowed that horizon to get down to under two years.  It doesn't take long for support to languish to the landfill category.  Case in point: regardless of Final Cut 6 being a Universal Binary that could run on PowerPC or Intel Macs, the install program for the Final Cut Studio 2 suite was PowerPC-only.  A $1K software box would no longer install *two years after it came out* because Rosetta was removed from Lion.}

    {Apple chooses on a whim to just stop supporting their old hardware/software in a new OS release to make you buy a new machine, I'm glad to see when they are [successfully sued](http://news.cnet.com/Mac-OS-X-refund-suit-gets-preliminary-nod/2100-1045_3-5099616.html) for doing this.  But the real fault lays upon a market that has not voted with its dollar to for open and accountable practices in the computing infrastructure we use.  So I will say it again: I am guilty, *guilty*, **guilty**!}

    {While success stories like the suit against Apple are rare, I applaud people like the Linux users who have successfully petitioned to [get a refund for Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_refund).  Because if they don't then you'll have problems like what happened to me trying to reinstall Lion.  Now you can't even buy a DVD of it.}

    {I don't have time today to write my own rant.  But here are some links where you can read other angry rants people have already put forth:}
