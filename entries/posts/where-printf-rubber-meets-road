print {After ignoring StackOverflow for a while, I decided to check up on it a bit lately.  Someone asked [a question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2442966/c-c-function-definitions-without-assembly/) that's one of those kind of fundamental curiosity issues that I enjoy explaining.  He said:}

quote {I always thought that functions like printf() are in the last step defined using inline assembly. That deep into stdio.h is buried some asm code that actually tells CPU what to do. Something like in dos, first mov beginning of the string to some memory location or register and than call some int. But since x64 version of Visual Studio doesn't support inline assembler at all, it made me think that there are really no assembler-defined functions in C/C++. So, please, how is for example printf() defined in C/C++ without using assembler code? What actually executes the right software interrupt?}

print << [

    {Obviously the answer is going to depend on the implementation.  Yet I thought that with the open-sourced GNU C Library, it would be pretty straightforward to show how most of it is in C but it bottoms out at `syscall`.  But it really was quite a maze to connect all the dots without doing any hand-waving!  So I found that my explanation just kept growing until it was so long that a blog entry was a more fitting format.}

    {So read on, fearless explorers, as we dig into the complicated answer to a seemingly simple question...}

print {We'll of course start with the prototype for `printf`, which is defined in the file [libc/libio/stdio.h](http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=libio/stdio.h;h=85542b1cfdbd50941d288dde8e22e678b10b1333;hb=HEAD)}

source 'C {
extern int printf (__const char *__restrict __format, ...);

print {You won't find the source code for a function called `printf`, however.  Instead, in the file [/libc/stdio-common/printf.c](http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=stdio-common/printf.c;h=4c8f3a2a0c38ab27a2eed4d2ff3b804980aa8f9f;hb=HEAD) you'll find a little bit of code associated with a function called `__printf`:}

source 'C {
int __printf (const char *format, ...)
{
    va_list arg;
    int done;

    va_start (arg, format);
    done = vfprintf (stdout, format, arg);
    va_end (arg);

print {A macro in the same file sets up an association so that this function is defined as an alias for the non-underscored `printf`:}

source 'C "ldbl_strong_alias (__printf, printf);"

print {It makes sense that `printf` would be a thin layer that calls `vfprintf` with `stdout`.  Indeed, the meat of the formatting work is done in `vfprintf`, which you'll find in [libc/stdio-common/vfprintf.c](http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=stdio-common/vprintf.c;h=5c9cac494a6db796a8263401f98964ae4b6a63a2;hb=HEAD).  It's quite a lengthy function, but you can see that it's still all in C!}

heading "Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole..."

print {`vfprintf` mysteriously calls `outchar` and `outstring`, which are weird macros defined in the same file:}

#define outchar(Ch) \

source 'C "#define PUTC(C, F) IO_putwc_unlocked (C, F)"

print {When you get to the definition of `IO_putwc_unlocked` in [libc/libio/libio.h](http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=libio/libio.h;h=3c9f2bd3e847429dcb14eb37d3b8369998bd19ee;hb=HEAD), you might start thinking that you no longer care how `printf` works:}

}

print {But despite being a little hard to read, it's just doing buffered output.  If there's enough room in the file pointer's buffer, then it will just stick the character into it...but if not, it calls `__woverflow`.  Since the only option when you've run out of buffer is to flush to the screen (or whatever device your file pointer represents), we can hope to find the magic incantation there.}

heading "Vtables in C?"

print {If you guessed that we're going to hop through another frustrating level of indirection, you'd be right.  Look in [libc/libio/wgenops.c](http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=libio/wgenops.c;h=e2adedd6d4d07c9f66b870de644d6c3d84848063;hb=HEADp) and you'll find the definition of `__woverflow`:}

__woverflow (f, wch)

print {Basically, file pointers are implemented in the GNU standard library as objects.  They have data members but also function members which you can call with variations of the `JUMP` macro.  In the file [libc/libio/libioP.h](http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=libio/libioP.h;h=854f049291c945b6ec2c552daefe901f23f95a4b;hb=HEAD) you'll find a little documentation of this technique:}

source 'C {
/* THE JUMPTABLE FUNCTIONS.

 * The _IO_FILE type is used to implement the FILE type in GNU libc,
 * as well as the streambuf class in GNU iostreams for C++.
 * These are all the same, just used differently.
 * An _IO_FILE (or FILE) object is allows followed by a pointer to
 * a jump table (of pointers to functions).  The pointer is accessed
 * with the _IO_JUMPS macro.  The jump table has a eccentric format,
 * so as to be compatible with the layout of a C++ virtual function table.
 * (as implemented by g++).  When a pointer to a streambuf object is
 * coerced to an (_IO_FILE*), then _IO_JUMPS on the result just
 * happens to point to the virtual function table of the streambuf.
 * Thus the _IO_JUMPS function table used for C stdio/libio does
 * double duty as the virtual function table for C++ streambuf.
 *
 * The entries in the _IO_JUMPS function table (and hence also the
 * virtual functions of a streambuf) are described below.
 * The first parameter of each function entry is the _IO_FILE/streambuf
 * object being acted on (i.e. the 'this' parameter).
