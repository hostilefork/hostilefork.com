print {Sorry for the lack of updates to the blog, but February was a busy month of leaving Los Angeles for Austin, March was taken up by SXSW, and April will involve finding a new apartment and furnishing it.  But I hope to return to recreational programming and writing articles about it soon enough!}

note {If you're visiting the site because you met me in Austin and got my card & want to talk more then please feel free to email/call or leave a comment.}
