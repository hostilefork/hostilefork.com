    {One area in C++ I had never really spent a lot of time with until early last year is the iostreams library.  I *thought* I understood it pretty well.  At a superficial level, it made perfect sense: replace printf/scanf with an abstract interface for serialization that objects could implement for themselves.}

    {As a developer whose post-stdio-era coding usually targeted things like graph databases instead of text files, I didn't have all that many occasions to use iostreams.  But as I became more involved in exchanging small conceptual programs with other developers, I realized that they are the *"lingua franca"* of standard C++.  Using them began to teach me that there were many things about them I didn't know...and that they could be very useful, as well as very tricky.}

    {For instance, do you know the difference between these two lines?}

print {I didn't!  That's just for starters, so I gave a presentation on the topic to my [Austin C/C++ Group](http://www.meetup.com/The-Austin-C-C-Meetup-Group/) in October 2011.  In it, I represent some of my new understandings:}

    {At first, I delayed on publishing it to the Web for fear that it may not be 100% right.  But then it languished in a private Google Docs presentation for a year and a half.  I found it today, and if I'm worried about its inaccuracy it's sure not going to get any better by leaving it there.  And it might help someone, as I know there are a large number of people on the Internet who are even more less than 100% right. :-P}

    {So here it is, and corrections are of course welcome--just leave a comment!}

note {Learning the details about this would not have happened without the help of the [active C++ community on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b?sort=votes%26pagesize=50).  That's where I spent most of my recreational programming time--instead of writing blog entries--in 2011.  Both asking and answering questions offers insights.  While some people seem to have a bit of what amounts to an "online game addiction", it's a case where their affliction can benefit you and the common good.  :P}
