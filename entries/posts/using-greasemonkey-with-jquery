    {Though I am all for technological empowerment, you'll often find me debating *against* the usage of web filtering website augmentation to "make bad sites more tolerable".  I like the idea that we have a common basis on which we are seeing "what's there".  It's discomforting to imagine sending someone a link that looked "perfectly fine" on your end, and then the recipient gets something entirely different... possibly offensive or malicious.}

    {So on matters of principle, I gave up ad blockers and filtering proxies a decade ago.  And I never got into installing the the scriptable "site-enhancing" scripts like Greasemonkey.  However, I was asked a favor that seemed like a good fit for GreaseMonkey, so I bit the bullet and said *"well, there is a tool for solving that..."*}

    {For reference, here is the simple basic boilerplate you need for a script that is going to work with jQuery.  At least in the current version.}

source 'javascript {
// ==UserScript==
// @name        Some String Naming Your Script
// @namespace   http://url.path.identifying.you
// @description Longer description of whatever the script is supposed to do
// @require     http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js
// @include     http://url.patterns/script-applies-to/you-can-use.wildcards.*
// @version     1
// ==/UserScript==

try {

    $('div.whatever').each(function() {
        /*... you're on the page, whatever JavaScript should work ... */
    });

} catch (err) {

    // If an error was thrown, go ahead and present it as an alert to help
    // with debugging any problems
    alert(err.toString());
}
}

    {The big non-obvious aspect here is that `@require` is how you include libraries, whereas `@include` is how you specify patterns of URLs you expect GreaseMonkey to apply your script to.  (So if you say `@include http://*`, it runs on every page.)}

    {The other not-made-completely-clear bit is that the namespace is supposed to be a URL path.  But once you've got those two things going, it works pretty well.  The `try/catch` helps too.}
