{Let's say you are implementing a class to represent a Phone.  You might want to have the precondition that you cannot `hangUp()` a phone if it was already hung up.}

{The typical way to do this is with `assert()` statements, so in the file **phone.cpp** you might write:}

[code cpp {
class Phone
{
private:
   enum Status {
      Dialing,
      Connected,
      Disconnected
   };
   Status _status;

public:
   void hangUp()
   {
      assert(_status != Disconnected);
      /*... some code here...*/
   }

   /*... more functions here ...*/
};
}]

{Then let's say in **caller.cpp** you are modeling someone who wants to have a ["typical"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob) phone conversation:}

[code cpp {
void Alice::callBob()
{
   _phone.dial("1-617-542-5942");
   friendlyGreetings();
   tellBruceSchneierJoke();
   haveSpecialDiscussion();
   _phone.HangUp();
}

void Alice::haveSpecialDiscussion()
{
   std::string password = askForThePassword();
   if (password == "hostilefork") {
      describeWorldTakeover();
      laughManiacally();
   } else {
      talkAboutTheWeather();
   }
   _phone.HangUp();
}
}]

{When `callBob()` executes and hits line 48, the Phone's assertion will fire because it was already hung up during `haveSpecialDiscussion()` (on line 60).  Most implementations of `assert` will capture the filename and line number where the actual assertion occurs, so you'd probably get a message like:}

[error "assertion failure on line 90 of phone.cpp"]

{There's no flexibility to let you indicate another "place" in the source.  For instance, what if you wanted the assert to identify the precise offending call to `hangUp()`?  }

{To address these kinds of needs I created `codeplace`.  One of its many uses is the location-parameterized assert...which lets you pass in a "place" to be identified when the assert triggers.  So in **phone.cpp** you would write:}

[code cpp {
public:
   void hangUp(const codeplace& cp)
   {
      assert(_status != Disconnected, cp);
      /*... some code here ...*/
   }
}]

{Then at the call sites, you would use a special macro called `HERE` to create a `codeplace` object which you pass as a parameter.  For instance, the assertion-triggering call to `hangUp()` in **caller.cpp** would look like this:}

[code cpp "_phone.hangUp(HERE(false));"]

[note {the forthcoming documentation for codeplace will explain what false, true, and string parameters mean for "HERE" mean...}]

{Now when the assertion is reported by the program, it will identify the call site.  With this change to our example above, you would get something more like:}

[error "assertion failure on line 48 of caller.cpp"]

{The location-parameterized assert is only one application of a codeplace.  They are helpful abstractions for any time we need to speak about a place in our source.  For instance, if we wanted to track the previous disconnection call we could have a local variable in the Phone class to save it... and the `tracked<T>` template even does this for you automatically.  There are some other nuances of the codeplace implementation that are beyond the scope of this particular issue.}

{You might theorize that run-time access to the stack is the ultimate API for dealing with this sort of thing.  Imagine if `Phone::hangUp()` could somehow obtain an object representing the call stack, and then extract whatever information it wanted about the callers. That's a little heavy-handed, and I believe that the odds of the API being abused are so high that a "narrower" protocol agreement between callers and subroutines would need to be established for the common scenarios.}
