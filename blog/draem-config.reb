	site-intro: [
		{An occasionally-updated collection of articles and notes.  Mostly about modern software engineering.  Main topics are C++11 and the Rebol and Red languages, along with general programming philosophy and puzzle-solving.}

		[heading {Site Reorganization in Progress}]

		{As of mid-2014, blog.hostilefork.com is a scrape and rewrite of content that was previously on the main page of hostilefork.com.  The [new main page](http://hostilefork.com) is starting the path toward being a more formal list of projects *(as opposed to blogs/articles/rants)*.  All old links should be forwarding correctly--so please let me know if you find one that isn't.}

		{In the transition from an ancient WordPress installation, I did something interesting.  After scraping the content, I encoded it into a [REN](https://github.com/humanistic/REN) *("REadable Notation")* format.  Then I made my own static site builder to generate the pages, called [Draem](https://github.com/hostilefork/draem), which has some very surprising properties...so you might check that out! The "source code" for this blog is available on GitHub as well:}

		https://github.com/hostilefork/hostilefork.com/tree/master/blog

		{I'll come up with a fancier index page than this.  But for now, the links here are enough for search engines (and me) to find the pages.  If you'd like, you can also [browse the site by tag](http://hostilefork.com/tag/).  There is some preliminary support for navigating the entries with the left and right arrow keys.}

		{I appreciate your feedback or suggestions, so feel free to get in touch by comment or mail!  Contact information is available on the [Hire the Fork](http://hostilefork.com/hire-the-fork/) page.}
