[{You may have already learned this since you wrote this post, but there is a solution to your problem with calling out returned values in Ruby. You said you marked values to return with a comment, presumably like ‘sentence_contents + "." # this is returned’. Ruby actually has a "return" keyword like C and Java, so you could just write that like ‘return sentence_contents + "."’. You can also use the return keyword to return from a function early, skipping any further code in the function, like in other languages.
As for whether you should end non-returning functions with nil, I’m not sure of that either. I don’t really like Ruby’s return system; it becomes a problem once your code becomes big enough that you can’t remember in your head whether each function returns a value or not. I solve this by making sure I always put "return" at the last line of functions that return values I will want to use, but that may be hard to get teammates to do, if you’re in a team project. I suppose another possibility would be to write your code such that all functions return useful values – functional rather than imperative style – but I’m not sure if that would end up too complicated or nonperformant in Ruby.}]
