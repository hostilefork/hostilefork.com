[{I wonder why anyone would be interested in maintaining that source, seems like a nightmare project. I couldn't read your whole explanation, it got way too deep too quickly (not suggesting it's your fault, the code is just too snakey).
Reminds me of Visual Studio 2010 which is supposed to have 1.5 million source files (not lines of code, files) and takes 16 hours to build unsigned (or 61 for a release build).
Never having worked on source of this scale I can't comprehend how people manage to stay motivated and keep it bug free.}]
