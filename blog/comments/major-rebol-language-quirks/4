[{There is an open source clone of the Rebol language .. see <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/Rebol-orca/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="liexternal">http://freshmeat.net/projects/Rebol-orca/</a> and it is still under developement.
BTW, your examples are being done with an old version of Rebol .. forall now resets the series back to the head on completion.  Current version is 2.7.6
Cheers,}]
