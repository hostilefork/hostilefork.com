[{Neat idea! In your examples for A and B, may I suggest you insert a space between the digits (for better physical proportions), and reverse the red and blue colors (I kept trying to "read" the blue characters, which are the background). And I think the crossbar for the A should be one row higher.}]

[{[I did something like this years ago to punch human-readable messages into paper tape (with an ASR-33 Teletype driven by a Data General Nova minicomputer, using BASIC), but used a 6-dot-high character, leaving an unpunched row along the edges of the tape to make it less easily tearable.
