[{Hi Duane...
Thanks for the suggestion!  Now that I've gotten around to reading the article, I am aware of the Dr. Dobbs method.  It works if you control the codebase completely.  But the problem is that as a library author, if you're supplying a class with an arbitrary number of parameterizations (such as any integer)...you can't really predict which ones to pre-specialize and export!
Since there's StackOverflow these days, I've phrased my actual issues more specifically there:
