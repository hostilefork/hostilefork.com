[{Hello Gerard, welcome back!
The REBOL/open-source discussion strays a bit from the main topic of the article (which is about complexity).  But I think most of the difference in our opinion is probably covered by the comment I posted immediately above.
I'll send you an email to follow up further and we can chat there...}]
