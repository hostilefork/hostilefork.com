[{O.K. just a quick followup. I got this to work, and a single pulse can be reconstructed! The problem was that the descending cascade of FIR filters were creating an ever increasing delay. This needs to be compensated with a large delay for the first (top) band and decreasing through to nothing for the lower bands.}]

[{I've got 6 bands with a 12 point (SSE) FIR's running at about 15% of my P4 cpu, which isn't great, but I can take advantage of the fact that every other sample is zero which would take nearly half the time. I might also look at QMF's now you've got me started, although I think that the delay aspect might get a bit...interesting...
Thanks again.}]
