[{So glad I read this. I was considering adding HotSpot to my kids' phone plan for my home internet. We live in an area where Time Warner Cable is the ONLY internet option, and I have sworn to never give them another penny. I have been living without internet almost 6 months (and I do not have a smartphone, just my kids do) and I still vow not to go back to them. I would rather drive the few miles to the local library than do business with a shady company like Time Warner. I was hoping Sprint was going to be my answer. :-(  Guess I'll wait for AT&T to install lines where I live.}]
