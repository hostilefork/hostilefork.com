[{@kkoehne Indeed, thanks!  Oddly enough I'd done this in my <a href="http://hostilefork.com/hoist/" rel="nofollow" class="liinternal">Hoist</a> library, so I was actually using an abstraction other than <code>QMessageBox</code> which handled that case.  I just forgot to mention it in the initial post!
I've updated with an alternative that will abort on any non-debug-spew information in a worker thread, so you know what's going on!  Seems better than sweeping it under the rug, but that's how I feel about compiler warnings too...}]
