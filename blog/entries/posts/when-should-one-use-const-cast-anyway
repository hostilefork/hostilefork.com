{I saw a question on StackOverflow asking about why one would use `const_cast`.  Because I've thought about that question lately I glossed over that they were asking specifically about applications of [casting away volatile](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3030382/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-const-cast-on-a-volatile/)...which I didn't even know you could use `const_cast` to do!}

{So I learned something.  But I thought the answer I wrote to why you would use `const_cast` at all was pretty decent, so I was going to leave it there.  But then I decided it was too off topic so I'd move it here.}

{The most *common* use of `const_cast` I've seen (with `const`) is this scenario:}

[list [

        {You're calling a library that has something like a `printFoo(Foo* fooPointer)` function, which clearly requires a non-const Foo.}

        {There's good reason to be "sure" this function doesn't modify the Foo, but you're unable to change the prototype or the source to express that knowledge for some reason.}

        {Your code has made an effort to only use `Foo*` in contexts where writability is needed and `const Foo*` in all other contexts.}

    ]]

{...that means that as a stopgap measure, you'll have to `const_cast` in order to cross this divide and call the routine.}

{OTOH, the most *legitimate* use I know of is in subsystems that own objects in a non-const sense, yet have cases where they hand back const pointers to callers.  The subsystem natively has more privileges on those objects, so if a caller passes one of those const pointers back it can "upgrade" the privileges.  }

{Sure, the subsystem could store a useless map from non-const pointers to const ones...but `const_cast` is more time and space efficient:}

[code cpp {
const SubsystemObject* Subsystem::getReadOnlyObjectById(int id) {
     SubsystemObject* subsystemObject = getObjectCore(id);

#ifdef WORLD_WITHOUT_CONST_CAST
     constMap[subsystemObject] = subsystemObject;
#endif

     return subsystemObject;
}

void Subsystem::someMethod(const SubsystemObject* constSubsystemObject) {
     SubsystemObject* subsystemObject;

#ifdef WORLD_WITHOUT_CONST_CAST
     subsystemObject = constMap[constSubsystemObject];
#else
     subsystemObject = const_cast<SubsystemObject*>(constSubsystemObject);
#endif

     doSomethingNeedingNonConstAccess(subsystemObject);
}
}]
