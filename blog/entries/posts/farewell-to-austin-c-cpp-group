[{It seems like only yesterday that I moved to Austin.  Well, actually it seems like two-and-a-half years ago (which it was).  Still, it was perceptually *non-linear*; some parts went faster and others slower, but it evened out in the end to the exact amount of time it actually took.}]

[{This reminds me of a scene from Steve Martin's The Jerk:}]

	[{I know we've only known each other four weeks and three days, but to me it seems like nine weeks and five days. The first day seemed like a week, and the second day seemed like five days...and the third day seemed like a week again, and the fourth day seemed like eight days.  And the fifth day you went to see your mother and that seemed just like a day.}]

	[{And then you came back... and later on the sixth day--in then evening--when we saw each other, that started seeming like two days.  So in the evening it seemed like two days spilling over into the next day and that started seeming like four days.  So at the end of the sixth day on into the seventh day, it seemed like a total of <i>five days</i>. And the sixth day seemed like a week and a half.}]

	[{I have it written down.  But I can show it to you tomorrow if you want to see it.}]

[{On Monday, I attended my <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Austin-C-C-Meetup-Group/events/100049362/">last session of the Austin C/C++ Group</a>.  And today I formally stepped down as organizer and am leaving it in hopefully-capable new hands.}]

[{But don't be a stranger!  Get in touch with an email or a comment.  And since I'm off to Montreal for the Rebol+Red "Recode" conference, I'll probably continue to be easy to find in the <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/291/">Rebol and Red Chat Room</a> on StackOverflow.}]

[{Thanks to everyone for helping expand the membership and scope of the Meetup...and thanks for all the good conversations over beer!}]
