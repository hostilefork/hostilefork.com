{Historically, I have always disliked the idea of using boolean test operations on types that can take a number of values.  This deep-seated aesthetic grudge comes from cases like this:}

[code cpp {
int x = 0;
if (not x)
   cout << "X is zero" << endl;
}]

{I'm simply bothered by this.  Perhaps it's a cognitive thing where I just don't feel there's any "truth" to the idea that every non-zero integer is somehow "true" but zero is somehow "false".  It could just as easily be that negative numbers are false and non-negative numbers are true.  Or if you ask a mathematical purist, they might suggest that at a more foundational level it is primes that are true and non-primes are false!}

{My comfort zone is when I'm only testing for "truth" and "falsehood" those things that can only have the values true and false.  If I could, I would enforce this.  So in the example above I would always write something more like:}

[code cpp {
int x = 0;
if (x == 0)
   cout << "X is zero" << endl;
}]

{That particular example is not very controversial, and I think most programmers would agree with me that's a better way to test against a literal zero.  It's just better code for capturing the intention.}

{Yet I have historically considered that a logical extension of "zero is not false" is the premise that "null pointers are not false".  And that belief *is* contrary to practice:}

[code cpp {
shared_ptr< foo > fooPointer;
if (not fooPointer)
   cout << "fooPointer is null" << endl;
}]

{In fact, look what a mouthful you get if you insist on comparing against null literally:}

[code cpp {
shared_ptr< foo > fooPointer;
if (fooPointer.get() == nullptr)
   cout << "fooPointer is null" << endl;
}]

{In the past I have tried to work around this by creating inline template wrappers like "isNull()" so that I could stick to my guns and avoid flattening pointers into booleans.  It doesn't cost any more in the runtime, so I figured what's the harm?}

[code cpp {
template< class T > inline bool isNull(shared_ptr< T > ptr) {
  return !ptr;
}
}]

{Yet I've decided this is a lost cause and too much of a speed bump in sharing my code with other C++ programmers.  They've accepted the notion that null pointers are false and non-null pointers are true, and you use boolean logic to test this--not some other operator.  It's not worth it to pick this particular fight.}

{I'm not happy about it.  But I now accept this *for pointers only*.  And I'm going to use "not" instead of "!"... it's part of the language and a lot more readable.}
