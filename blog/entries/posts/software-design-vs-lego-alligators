{I saw The LEGO Movie last month on my birthday, and it was pretty good--especially the animation.  Whenever I see things like that, it reminds me how much LEGO has affected the lens through which I see engineering *(not to mention reality in general)*.}

{But there are some LEGOs,so I thought I would write a little bit about the advantages and pitfalls of the LEGO-like mindset of many programmers.  First, a little history...}

[heading {My first LEGO set}]

{When I was a child, my environment was a somewhat chaotic hodgepodge of...stuff.  "Antique furniture" *(which were really just hand-me-downs, of no likely value)*.  We moved a lot, and so things were not tailored particularly to the environment.}

[note {I've become a bit "OCD" now, where I can't tolerate the idea of something like a dresser that goes up over a windowsill because that's the dresser you had.  So I just get rid of everything and get all new stuff if I move.}]

{My first LEGO set was given to me as a Christmas present when I was 6.  It was different from other things I'd seen.  I have said that it was on par with an alien spaceship landing in the middle of my world.  The specific set I received was [Universal Building Set #744](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/744_Universal_Building_Set), and it actually had a very simple motor with a switch.}

{Humorously, I wouldn't touch it.  My parents tried to show me the concept of how LEGO worked, and asked what was wrong.  I pointed at the box and said "It says ages 7-12.  I'm 6."  :-)  After having it explained that is a guideline to try and keep you from eating the pieces, I quickly believed it to be the greatest toy I'd ever seen.}

{And it was the entirety of the "unboxing" that distinguished it.  One of the things about the packaging is making the unboxing experience feel as if the parts you are receiving have a "place".  You could even examine a LEGO set to see what pieces were in it by lifting the lid at the store.}
