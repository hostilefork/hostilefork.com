{This is the list of projects authored and supported from hostilefork.com.  As part of the major web overhaul, all projects are being slowly redesigned and revamped.  That includes writeups, demos, YouTube videos, and logos.  No one said it would be easy.  :-/  A better index method *(fancy sliding gallery, etc.)* is on the agenda once all the content is lined up.}

[heading {Black Highlighter}]

{[Black Highlighter](http://blackhighlighter.org) implements a jQuery widget that brings the tool of redaction to the masses.  Unlike existing redaction tools, there is a sharp focus on *cryptographically committing* to what was contained in the missing portions.  This means that if an accountability process requires the revelation of a redacted portion, the system catches a revelation that is different from what was originally redacted.}

[heading {Albumist}]

{When the band The Legendary Pink Dots needed to track their releases on their website, [Albumist](http://albumist.hostilefork.com) was created as a web mash-up from the Freebase graph database.  It generates a thumbnail discography that can be explored and augmented with information *(such as links to promotional deals)*, and is easy for others to use just by changing the artist ID.  Originally written in 2008 as a mootools script to use with Joomla 1.5, it was resurrected in 2014 as a jQuery plugin--as well as to use cover art from the Internet Archive.}

[heading {CopyLight}]

{Some websites--even high profile ones--have been going ever farther to cripple users web browsers to break text copying functionality.  This sabotage is under the claim of wanting to "protect their content" *(frequently including quotes or excerpts from other sources)*.  [CopyLight](http://copylight.hostilefork.com) is a jQuery plugin experiment to tag HTML nodes with their licenses, and offer feedback (such as watermarks, or an alert button) to guide users to consider how the material can be shared.  It does this while keeping copy working as normal, and the user need not do any extra work to interact with or dismiss the alerts.}

[heading {USCII}]

[button https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hostilefork/uscii/master/uscii-logo.png 640x360 "USCII" http://uscii.hostilefork.com/]

{Conventional character encoding schemes often lack instrinsically meaningful connections between the numbers and the symbols or control codes they represent.  *(For instance, ASCII's 65 for "A".)*  [USCII](http://uscii.hostilefork.com/) is a somewhat fanciful reimagination of how to pick larger numbers that encode bitmaps, where they have a prime width and a prime height--leveraging a scheme in the spirit of the Arecibo message that was beamed into space.  There's a fun online encoder and decoder, which explain how the methodology works.}

[heading {TitleWait}]

[button https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hostilefork/titlewait/master/titlewait-logo.jpg 640x360 "TitleWait" http://titlewait.hostilefork.com/]

{In the current software ecology, processes are frequently launching others and then disconnecting, crashing on some unexpected dependency, or hanging in a way conventional APIs can't kill.  [TitleWait](http://titlewait.hostilefork.com) is a program launcher to use in automated testing that under the hood is actually a MS Windows debugger--which gives it a level of control you won't find in programs like AutoHotkey.  It has several interesting features, but as the name suggests it can match regular expressions in window title bars.  This creates a lightweight method for communicating status information from JavaScript in a browser to the automated test script.}

[heading {Draem}]

[button https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hostilefork/draem/master/draem-logo.png 640x360 "Draem" http://draem.hostilefork.com]

{hostilefork.com was held captive for a many years to a very old WordPress installation.  My programming nature led me to desire to maintain and version my site as if it were source code *(a growing trend among programmers who have switched to "static site builders")*.  I made my own, which is called [Draem](https://github.com/hostilefork/draem)...and similar to other offerings it does paragraphs in MarkDown.  However, the whole toolchain it uses is only half a megabyte, and it can easily do structural transformations as I rethink the format.}

[heading {Flatworm}]

[button https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hostilefork/flatworm/master/flatworm-logo.jpg 640x360 "Flatworm" http://flatworm.hostilefork.com/]

{[Flatworm](http://flatworm.hostilefork.com) was an investigation into achieving a low-latency proxy server.  The design goal was that it be easy to author filters to rewrite traffic as it went by...while handling the necessary bookkeeping to make sure information in headers was adjusted if necessary.}

[note {This was originally intended to inject frames in YouTube videos on my WLAN and freak people out, the YouTubes (at least) have wised up and are using HTTPS now.  It is thus less interesting than it once was, and not likely to be further developed.}]

[heading {Rubol}]

http://rubol.hostilefork.com

[note {This project was an educational experiment, and has not been advanced since 2009.  Development might be resumed, but is not currently high on any priority list.}]

[heading {jquery-numband}]

{This was a small experiment that came out of wanting to demonstrate a UI design principle in an answer to a User Experience Design StackExchange question.}

[note {Beyond keeping the demo working, it is unlikely to be developed further unless someone else needs it and does the work.}]
