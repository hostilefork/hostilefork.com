[{Hi Eugene, thanks for the suggestions.  In this particular case, the computer I want to control is a Mac...and the computer I want to control it with is a PC.  So the cross-platform solution of TeamViewer is what I need.  (I'm guessing there's probably better performance in some of the single-platform solutions, though.)}]
