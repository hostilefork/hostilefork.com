[{A better stackoverflow post to link to about warnings is probably this one: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5088460/flags-to-enable-thorough-and-verbose-g-warnings/9862800#9862800" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="liexternal">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5088460/flags-to-enable-thorough-and-verbose-g-warnings/9862800#9862800</a>
Of course, I may be biased because that is my post, but I used the page you linked as a starting point. I then went through the gcc documentation, removed warnings that were implied by other warnings and added anything that was missing. I then removed a few "bad warnings" and documented why I did so.}]
