[{There is no fixed limit to the number of activations. You may have to convince Microsoft over the phone that your need is legitimate, but I've never had a problem doing that. Though it is definitely a pain.
Microsoft has publicly committed to release a patch to disable all XP activation requirements prior to any deactivation of their activation systems. So unless they go out of business or renege on that promise, lack of support shouldn't be a problem in the future.
However, I 100% agree on your main point. I just don't think this is as good an example as you do.}]
