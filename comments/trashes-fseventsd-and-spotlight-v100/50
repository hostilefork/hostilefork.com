[{I have been fighting these files for several years now. When I plug in an UltraProjector (solid state projector, <a href="http://www.ultraprojector.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="liexternal">http://www.ultraprojector.com</a>), the Mac put those files there and the stupid ROCKCHIP player hardware in this projector just locks up. Because of this, making these files would probably not help.
But, the Eject to Windows can simplify the command-line "rm" option I have been using to kill the ".*" files.
I am glad I found this post &#8212; I am in the process of documenting how to use the UltraProjector on a Mac, and I fear my list of Terminal commands might have been a bit overwhelming to casual users :)}]
