[{Now, for anyone defending those damn mac files, keep in mind that I don't have a mac, and I don't want one putting any file on my flash drive unless it's told to do so by a user.  Another interesting bug you overlooked, the mac also, for some strange reason known only to Steve Jobs and sea slugs, changes the icon of the flash drive to some messed up file folder.  I don't want my friends' computers to do this to my flash drive.  The reason as to why Steve Jobs has had to counter every innovation he made with the lack of a windows innovation  (i.e. mouse pointer speed precision), I do not know.  I also do not understand why Macs have to alienate themselves from windows machines, a move that can only work if you control the better halves of both the market and the software (Macs do not dominate either of these fields).  Mistaking my flash drive as a porcelain throne is just another reason I can't stand those damn macs.}]
