[{You guys seem so ignorant. If you don't know how unix-based operating systems work, then gtfo and go back to Win 95, you ms sheeple.
I've known about these files since middle school. Ask yourself if your OS automatically indexes the contents of its volumes, allows you to store trash data without immediately deleting the file (a big reason most people probably come to you for data recovery in the first place), or allows you to store an icon to a volume on the disk itself! These are just some of the "self-serving" features these files enable.
If you suspect a disk to be needing recovery, NEVER plug it in to anything without making sure it won't write to it. Duh... use a disk utility.
TZ, see the little "lock" switch on your SD card? Didn't think so.
The majority of you guys just seem to wander into the Mac store and expect them to work like Windows.  Go watch Pirates of Silicon Valley and you'll know why a lot of things are the way it is today, computer wise.
Computers are tools built by people with unique philosophies. Apple's philosophy is make the customer happy, and never make anything they wouldn't want themselves. MS's philosophy, unfortunately, involves making as much money with as little effort as possible.}]
