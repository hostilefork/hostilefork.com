["Hi, everyone!"]

[{First of all, I'd like to mention that I'm NOT a confident user and that's why I want to draw the audience's attention to the unanswered question:
If these files are already on the removable drive, can they just be deleted without causing any corruption, or is there a specific process to remove them?
I have those files on my removable drive and know for sure that they are not to be removed without a specific procedure. Would appreciate the detailed description of what I have to do.}]
