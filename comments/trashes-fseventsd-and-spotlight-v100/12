[{Thanks.  I've never really understood why MacOS "speak with forked tongue" &#8212; seems an unnecessary complication, like the Windows Registry.  (Dear Windows: If a program needs configuration data, store it in a damn file in the program directory!)
I guess the extra "._" files make sense for cross-file-format compatibility though.}]
