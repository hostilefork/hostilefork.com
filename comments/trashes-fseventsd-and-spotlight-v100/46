[{All very technical and good but I use an iMac for day to day computing and a Nikon D70 as a camera.  I download the jpeg files to the Apple but find that the .fsevetsd, .trashes and ._.trashes files then render the compact flash useless when reinserted in the Nikon.  I end up booting up an old Windows laptop to reformat the card before use - reformatting in the camera does not work and assume reformatting in the Mac would still leave these files behind - lost half a dozen photos yesterday because of this!}]

[{Suggestions of alternative methods of overcoming this welcome.}]
