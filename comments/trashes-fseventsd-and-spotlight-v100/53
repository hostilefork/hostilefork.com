[{i wonder if it could be used to redact content from emails already sent?. How i wish i had the facility to Kill a sent mail before the recipient possibly actually opened it.
At least if something i wasn't sure about was Black Highlighted, i could pull it back, or it flags to the reader i'm not really sure.
No doubt all govt documents would then be sent fully blacked all the time diminishing the benefit thereof.}]
