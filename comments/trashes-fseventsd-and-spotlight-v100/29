[{There should be some standard way - maybe in prefs - to force MacOSX not to put this garbage on the drive.  Right now you have to manually put FOUR! pieces of your own junk on the drive to prevent OSX from doing it.
For some reason, it doesn't pollute my SD card when it is in my Samsung camcorder and I attach it.  But if I put the same SD card in an adapter, it throws the garbage on, so I know it can do it.
My problem is less with Apple deciding to do this than with leaving no way to turn it off.}]
