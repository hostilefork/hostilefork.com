[{I need urgent help: my friend has connected my portable external hard drive to your Mac, but Mac did not recognize the external HD.}]

[{After that I tried to connect the external HD on my PC (Windows Vista) and the drive no longer appears. I used Windows tools and I can notice that the external HD is connected, but I can´t access any content.
By a data recovery software, I can see the complete original contents in the external HD, but also has in it some new files (to me) as: .Trashes and .Fseventsd.
I believe that by the recovery program data I can copy the contents of the external HD to my PC, but I appreciate help me with:}]

["- Is there any way to undo what the Mac did??"]

[{- Also I am not knowing how I'll be able to access the external HD from my PC (for instance: if necessary to format the external HD) since I can´t see it from PC.
Thanks}]
