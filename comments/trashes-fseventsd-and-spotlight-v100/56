[{Not using my macbook for development anymore, will NOT work with a company that uses macbooks. Got my USB drive back and had to erase around 4000ish useless 4k files off my 1T drive, it was like i didn't even recognize the drive anymore. If your company uses macbooks and requires you to plug in my usb drive to do whatever task you are paid to do.. you just lost my business..}]
