[{Interesting stuff! (I worked on Qt Concurrent back in the Qt 4.4 days)
Have you had a look at the Clojure programming language and its persistent data structures? (see <a href="http://clojure.org/state" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="liexternal">http://clojure.org/state</a>). I've considered experimenting with something similar for Qt: data structures were you can create read-only snapshots that are guaranteed to be stable, and where the writers pay for the copy-on-write. Your SnapshotPointer seems to be a similar thing.}]
