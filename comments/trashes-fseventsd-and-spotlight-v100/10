[{Thanks!  I just noticed those files/folders on a flash drive that had I most recently used with a borrowed laptop (Win XP Pro) while on vacation.  I thought the laptop had been infected, since it had outdated anti-virus and no firewall.  (It came from my girlfriend's office and she didn't want me putting on any of the GOOD security tools I use.)  
BUT, having read this, I remember that the day before the vacation, I had been in a computer store and had plugged the flash drive into a MacBook on sale, to see if it could transparently read my existing files.  So that's how I got these stupid things!  I can stop writing my long e-mail to my girlfriend about how her office laptop may be infected...
(I was checking out the MacBook because with slightly dropping Apple prices and the rare sale, the MacBook was "only" $200 more than comparable WinXP and Win7 notebooks.  (Comparable except for the Mac's dinky 13 inch screen, that is, but I guess that contributes to the long battery life.)
I'm going to put the files you recommend on all my flash and USB drives just in case I ever plug any of them into a Mac again.
Oh, there is one other thing that the MacBook wrote on the flash drive that you didn't mention in your blog: a file (not folder) in the root called "._.Trashes".}]
