[{Nice try on Godwin's Law. Unfortunately, the law explicitly states that it is not invoked when one uses the term 'nazi' to invoke it.
Also, it is shameful because Apple made an assumption that it can just write what it wants to a drive I may be just using to store files. Like 10TB of files. Now it's full of 230,000 files of this garbage.
The other mystery is why some file dates get changed. I've had to resort to mounting these volumes read-only from my desktop mac till I can trust mac to play nice. Especially when the file date is a critical piece of information I'm trying to record.}]
