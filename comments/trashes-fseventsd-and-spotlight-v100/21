[{Steve:
Actually I'm with Randy on that point. Windows (since NT) is the only OS to store its configuration in a single monolithic and vulnerable datastore. Whenever possible, I force all my programs to store its settings in its own program folder. This way I have never lost important configuration data and have rarely, if ever, had to actually reinstall anything, except for windows itself and I haven't reformatted in over ten years.
However, in the current 21st century climate of pandering to the low-browed, formatting-is-a-solution-for-everything and OMG BIG BUTTONS! masses, I wouldn't advise non-techs to do this.}]
