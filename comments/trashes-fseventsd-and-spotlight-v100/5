[{Folks connecting external drives to a Mac should mount them read-only if they don't want them written to (just like a savvy user would 'mount -r' or 'mount -o ro' under Linux).  Here's a prefpane ("ReadOnlyMounter") that helps with that:

I agree, the use of .Cruftiness to tell Spotlight and fseventsd and Finder not to drop crap on my drives is irritating.  I use these to help with that:

To be honest, I'd rather live with this stuff than with Windows Vista constantly rearranging my desktop icons and resetting my folder views on its whim, because it thinks one file is a photograph, so therefore the whole folder must contain photos and i must want to view them as tiles, even though every other bleeding time i viewed the folder i viewed it as a Detailed List.  At least Apple makes it possible to turn it off....}]
