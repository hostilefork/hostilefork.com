[{Nice article.  I'd add immersive nature as sorely lacking in the computing field along with the tunnel vision most of us are apt to fall into.
Thinking Rebol is fun (and Good-ness) but not completely immersive.  Thinking Forth is both.  Thinking Lisp is Emacs and well, I chose vi many many moons ago.  Thinking C is an impossible hodge podge of tools and "assistants".
So far, in my experience, Forth is the only environment where the crayons and the map come in the same box.  In the box in cuisinart form but you get to live in the box.
Rebol is so close it drives me nutters some days, the map is glued to the box and the box is the cuisinart.  But it has no console editor (or way of finding source code), so you have to leave the box with the one 4-colour crayon to get to the map glued to the side.  The wall of the box is thin, but you still have to leave and go outside to apply the colour.
I kinda scoff at the expression 'think outside the box'.  I wanna think inside the box and when finished thinking the box is the thing.
And all this to leave you with;  Make sure you check out Piet.  Mostly harmless, but colourful.}]

Cheers and keep up the Art.}]
