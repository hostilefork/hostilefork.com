[{Excellent answer! 
However, I think you made the wrong decision to publish it only on your blog instead of on StackOverflow as well. The whole point of StackOverflow is to collect questions and answers in one place, not have a link collection to answers that will eventually disappear in the next blog redesign/not be properly cached/archived.
There is no real limit to the size of a posted answer, not everything can be explained in short stubs so feel free to use as many chars as you need. (The vim-question on SO is a great example of a highly appriciated [some might even say epic] answer spanning multiple screen pages.) StackOverflow users are not daunted by the size of a reply, they are there to learn. 
Please edit your answer on StackOverflow to include the full blog posting.}]

["Again; Excellent blog post!"]
