[{uclibc is a better version to see, glbic is insanely complicated.  the uclibc version is somewhat crazy as well, but that's because printf is a fairly complicated function with all the conversions built into it, but is basically contained in a single file.
you can see this in other places with how glibc does crazy stuff when doing simple things such as wrapping system calls.}]
