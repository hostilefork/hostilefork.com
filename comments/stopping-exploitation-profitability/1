[{Why do you expect there to be less exploitation in the human animal world than there is in that of the 'lesser' beasts? It is completely natural to for animals to exploit their positions of power whether these come by chance, from a physical advantage, higher mental capacity, geographic location, etc.
Despite this observation, I'm with you on trying to make this world a bit better, maybe by exposing larger corporate entities which are blatantly exploiting consumer lack of information. For example, over here in Canada, we have the top two big-box stores, Best-Buy and Future Shop which operate as supposed competitors when Future Shop was bought out by Best Buy in 2001. They send out separate fliers and create the false illusion of competition when there is none.
Another example is in the reporting of certain facts by news media ultimately owned by large corporations that have a vested interest in getting only one side of the story out.
There should be constant, daily, reminders to the public that the truth is not what it seems, with examples of the deception. Where would this be published though, in an unbiased way, so that it can reach the masses. Every platform has some large entity behind it. If it doesn't, then it likely doesn't have the reach needed.}]
