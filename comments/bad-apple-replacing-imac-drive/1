[{I bought the "Giottos Rocket Air Blaster" on your recommendation here and I'm quite impressed! Compressed air probably works better but seems to have a short shelf life after the first use. I also don't like dealing with it when it drips. This thing fits the bill there well enough, but its biggest asset has turned out to be how much dust it can easily get off (and sometimes out) of keyboards.
Hope you're having a fun journey.}]
