[{@Alfred: the story ends with the computer taken to the hardware recycling, and me wishing I'd just donated the thing rather than undertaking the project.  It turned out the project I had intended it for didn't even happen.
Then again, one can't change the past.  It's educational...in a way.  There are all kinds of things one can learn from taking things apart, and now I know more about how these things are put together and what kinds of methods you use to take them apart.  (Sure I could watch a YouTube video, but it's not the same...)}]
