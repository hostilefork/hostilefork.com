[{You are one of the cleverest people I know. The call-the-new-service-number approach just reinforced it.
Completely off topic, I once read somewhere the way they allocated 2G spectrum in a few countries: US, England, India and New Zealand. Out of the 4, I think NZ was the best.
US made out different areas, called them 'circles' maybe, and tried getting companies to bid for them. The phone companies just made a cartel and divided the areas among themselves before the actual bidding, and maybe that continued till now and the new area you move to will have only T-Mobile. No benefit to government, none to people, unless they were lucky to be in an area with a good carrier.
India simply 'sold' 2G licenses to a company called 'Swan Telecom', which was not even a real telecom company, and they re-sold/leased the licenses to different telecom companies. Government got very less benefit because of less tax due to no bidding, but the people got really, really cheap mobile connections. India has the cheapest mobile phone usage in the world, but overall this led to a lot of controversy.
England went into another approach: kind of having bidding run-ffs as they have in French presidential elections. In the end, the government there got a hell lot of money from the bidding process. I don't remember too much about the way the English went about it.
NZ had the best approach: make companies bid, but with a rather good rider. The winning bidder would have to pay the amount equal to the second biggest bid. This meant that the companies could bid more and more, ultimately leading to benefit to the government there.
I think the small size of England and NZ made things simpler. Maybe they did not have any different circles/areas etc.}]
