[{Thanks for sharing! I found though that the gdb built from std sources will not be able to use qt5 debuggung symbols provided by distro (ubuntu 13.10 in my case), own-built gdb will show errors like this:
BFD: /usr/lib/debug/.build-id/52/285239fde688ff5dc15a1c16d06bac4233f801.debug: unable to initialize decompress status for section .zdebug_aranges
When I build from ubuntu sources (apt-get source gdb) (also adding to configure &#8211;with-separate-debug-dir=/usr/lib/debug), it works, so now I see the qt symbols loaded.}]
