[{I had the same problem after upgrading Linux Mint to the latest version. Qt Creator 3.0 is already available to download on <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="liexternal">http://qt-project.org/downloads</a>}]

[{This version works without any problems with gdb 7.6.1 built against Python3.}]
