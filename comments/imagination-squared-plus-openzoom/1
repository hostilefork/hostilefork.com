["I love this. Places I want to see it applied:"]

["Websites for"]

[{&#8211;artists (portfolios&#8211;this includes visual artists, but also musicians placing album covers, etc.)}]

[{&#8211;DVDs/CDs, related media (same with books&#8211;can see this on iTunes in their store, or Amazon, etc.)}]

["&#8211;museums (collections)"]

["&#8211;libraries (collections)"]

[{&#8211;booksellers (book covers, subdivided by authors/genres/bestsellers, all sorts of queryable categories that will then populate a large visual grid)}]

[{&#8211;magazines (every cover of the publication in one grid)}]

[{&#8211;School yearbooks online&#8211;with ALL of the students from the start of the school till the present in a continual grid, with superimposed and/or mouseover visual breaks for year}]

["&#8211;Personnel photos on company websites"]

[{&#8211;Law enforcement lists&#8211;missing children/FBI Most Wanted/Watch lists}]

[{&#8211;Photo-sharing sites (Flickr, etc. So you can stitch your album together...)}]

["&#8211;Bridal photography"]

["&#8211;Periodic Table educational infographic"]

["&#8211;History timelines for  educational sites"]

[{&#8211;Blog indices (using a graphic and/or key word for reference)}]

[{&#8211;FB Friends grid (where you can see all 5,000 at once rather than scrolling)}]

["&#8211;Online menus for restaurants"]

[{&#8211;Even basic search engine results, eventually, when we get better at taxonimizing tags and auto-generating intuitive tag clusters. 
I'll stop there but I keep thinking of more. The basic thing though, for me, is that it moves large information sets towards a highly navigable infographic model that is visually intuitive. In my mind, this is much more how the internet should be. And will be.}]
