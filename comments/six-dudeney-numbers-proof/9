[{"88 is the last number for which the right hand side is bigger than the left, and from then on we know that log(value)—even multiplied by a constant and added to another constant—will not have the possibility of catching up with value again."
Clarification:}]

[{Using Wolfram Alpha, you can find that the derivative of (36+27*log10(x))-x is 27/(x ln(10))-1, and this function stays at the negative part forever beyond a certain point. Therefore (36+27*log10(x))-x never goes up again.}]
