[{Parentheses, yes there is useless one but I imagine it is for clarity purpose.
Anyway, nice demonstration !
Here is just another implementation for interleave-block :
interleave-block: func [block [block!] item /local pos] [}]

["    loop subtract length? block 1 ["]

["    ^^-block: insert next block item"]

["    ]"]

["    return head block"]

[{]

if block length is 1 or 0, then no loop occurs, so no item is inserted.}]
