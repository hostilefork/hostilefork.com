[{@Cloudy0: Such formalism is absolutely valuable, so thanks!  Though once you start saying "derivative" and "ln" many people's eyes glaze over.  I don't know if you've read Lockhart's Lament or not, but his point about the "excessive" proof about intersecting lines and angles is something I'll mention:

It would be nice if we could drill down into an argument to the level of our curiosity.  So if you want to know the exact zero you could click to see how to find it with the right equations, but if you're willing to accept a "good enough for the purpose" approximation then you could just keep reading.
Some day they'll finish <i>A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer</i> :)
