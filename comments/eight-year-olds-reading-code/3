[{Hi, I like your articles on Rebol; they give an insight into the area of coding that I want to read more about. It's probably the only language to have so much stress on simplicity on design than performance.. I also agree with Carl and you that complexity of a system should be kept minimal; increased complexity tends to brings down the predictable nature of any machine..}]
