[{Very thoughtfull article, not sure to understand the whole C++ stuff but I remember something we demonstrate at school 1=0.99999 ... in theory :) 
I also love your remark about Rebol braces, I never thought about it consciously but I feel I have always liked Rebol because of Rebol capability to "handle embedded braces as long as they match up". This will probably inspire an article in the future where I will refer to yours.}]
