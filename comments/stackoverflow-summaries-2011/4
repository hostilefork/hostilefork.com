[{Reputation points sound like another name for a like button. In practice, I think it's difficult for such a system to not amount to insta-popularity contests for various posts, pictures, videos, and such. Writing something takes more time, and so, perhaps more thought than might go into the decision of whether or not to click a mouse button... should I send that email, order some stuff, take a stance on that post? How can you separate quality votes from those unfairly cast? The whole thing just gets so complicated and cumbersome that it seems unworkable, though not as bad as our actual democratic system! I also think the idea of $100 bill jars belongs in the douchebag jar:

That's some offensive wealth-flaunting nonsense.}]
