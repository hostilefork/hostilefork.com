[{Reputation points sound like another name for a like button. In practice, I think it's difficult for such a system to not amount to insta-popularity contests for various posts, pictures, videos, and such.

How can you separate quality votes from those unfairly cast? The whole thing just gets so complicated and cumbersome that it seems unworkable, though not as bad as our actual democratic system!
