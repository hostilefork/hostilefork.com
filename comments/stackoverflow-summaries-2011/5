[{<em>(Ed's note: This was left by someone who identified themselves simply as "me".  I added the quotes to emphasize that while I agree with the sentiment in a fairly deeply semiotic way, the below paragraph wasn't left by the operator of this blog.  That operator's name is also not Ed...that's short for editor.  Sighned, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe4EK4HSPkI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="liexternal">The Mgmt</a>)</em>
Baby animals of all kinds have distinctive appearances that limit aggression from adults of the same species.  New users should have something similar by their name (like a yellow border) so it is harder to accidentally flame them.  Naturally you have to Tell people to be nice to the newbies but this should make it easier for them to comply.}]
