[{Hello,
Intriguing design.  The brackets - yes, but using the "O" to represent the series, it doesn't.  I mean, there is not a lot of series portrayed by one symbol, or even the portrayal of a word,  However, maybe the block, as represented by the brackets (and the block itself), and something to represent the series would make a good logo.  As to what would replace the "o" - sorry,  have no real idea myself.  Not good,  
Perhaps the logo might even be an animated logo, with a number of elements of a series coming and going, or if a regular static logo, a number of different series in the brackets rather than just the one normally expected.  Dynamic sort of.   Not just one logo, but say 10 official logos.  Otherwise, the block and brackets are interesting, perhaps the reflection section below them detracts a bit, it being too prominent or maybe it might not be needed.  Best logo ever so far anyway!}]
