[{Heya R. Zed,
I agree that the single symbol of the O does not particularly semiotically suggest a series.  You might think an ellipsis or something like that would be better.  Had I been starting from a completely clean slate I might choose a different baseline, but note the source of the inspiration was the existing logotype... and history is one of the things that designers get to draw from in rebranding.
But what makes it good in my opinion is that it's a *system*...a motif... not a drawing.  The shadowing is incidental.  As you noted, the real stars of the show are the square brackets.  Then there's this black and white sort of materials fabrication thing going on.  As one Reboler said: "It looks like a pill a machine would swallow."
I think it's strong and will serve well, and adapts well in flatter formats e.g. the Android version:

So I think we have settled this one; it's a league or two above the PHP logo and that's as much as we need to invest in.  But there are some issues with typography and variations on the logo for Red, more ideas are welcome!  Come join us in the chat room:
