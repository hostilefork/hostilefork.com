[{I started a conversation about this idea on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c++/browse_thread/thread/1d55e916362ec678/9326a8847b8f76ea#9326a8847b8f76ea" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="liexternal">comp.lang.c++</a>.  It went a bit all over the place, but has some ideas I might end up integrating into this article.}]
