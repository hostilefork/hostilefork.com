[{Hi Graham - Thanks for the pointer to ORCA!  It doesn't look like it's under too active a development, but an interesting start.  The project name is already taken in software by Sun for a screen reader, maybe FREEBOL would be better.  :) 
I'd think that breaking it into two apps (one with a graphics subsystem and one without) would be ideal.  Small EXE size shouldn't be a key goal, just small source code and leveraging existing effort.  For instance, it should probably be written in C++ with Boost to handle things like cross platform file paths:

And perhaps the Boehm garbage collector could manage a lot of the GC issues:

But the real question comes down to Rebol Technologies' willingness to allow an open source kernel to use their mezzanine functions.  If they're not willing, that would make it almost impossible for anyone to reasonably build an interchangeable interpreter.
Was there any reaction to ORCA in terms of the legal issues?  Should a statement be pushed for?}]
