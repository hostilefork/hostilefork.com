[{Hi Gregg!  Good to have an experienced Rebol programmer visiting the site...
Interesting, I got the idea in my head that Rebol actually didn't permit you to put a newline in a statement unless there was an open brace from somewhere.  Possibly early on working with the command line, and I just never saw code that did otherwise.  I've updated that section of the article, thanks!
Please feel free to point any Rebol developers you know to this stuff so it gets more eyeballs auditing it.  I'm trying a grassroots campaign to hopefully push Rebol a little more into the public awareness.  Even like, by making little icons and such:

But I'd like to be correct on my technical and philosophical arguments, at least.   My hope is to maybe help bridge some of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/comments/6vo0q/why_i_havent_looked_at_Rebol_much/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="liexternal">the divide</a> with the communities of influence that have made Ruby and Python so successful.  Seems there must be a way...}]
