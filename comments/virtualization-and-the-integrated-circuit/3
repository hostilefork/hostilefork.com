[{The broad question of "What ought we waste in order to maximally produce?" has had many answers over the course of history.  When the answer to that goes through a period of change, fortunes are made and lost.  Also this question, coupled with efficiency expertise, forms the crux of many engineering trade-off problems.}]

[{You prophetically notice that bridging from wasting processor cycles to wasting virtual machines may be a next step for many.  I know that my group is well on its way toward that today.}]
