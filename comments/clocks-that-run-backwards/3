[{I've seen 24 hour clocks for sale every now and then, but they run forwards. While they could be re-divided decimally there is a lot of cultural entrenchment in the fact that seafarers some centuries ago divided the globe into 360. That would also have to change. Now insurance companies are still - STILL - tagging extensions to professional indemnity policies based on the Y2K bug rearing its head in litigation - any excuse to charge for more. I'd hate to see what upheaval comes from re-ordering peoples into something simpler. The "system" that keeps the great unwashed dumbed-down and in their place relies on things staying complicated. 
In view of the above, as for decimal it would be more immediately beneficial if the six minute division were marked ( especially in the iOS PickerObjects ) as some enterprise sectors charge by the 6 minute increment. 
as to the pi issue, there are some ladies around town here who have already implemented twice that value to their waistlines. Maybe we should cut them open in the name of science. . 
hmm could the raspberry pi people double their production too?}]
