[{Glad you remember.  It's interesting that this movement is getting momentum decades later and I would have met personally the person with the biggest push for it (as a reaction to "pi day").  Coincidence, or psychic phenomenon?  :) 
I'm on the fence as to whether understanding the tradeoffs involved is the real baby in this particular bathwater.  This (obvious?) mistake could be seen as a bit of a "hazing"...a way of saying that if your mind is not able to correct for something so minor then you probably shouldn't be pursuing math.
I hear your point about the dot.  Yes, in a "pure" math foundation I feel like this constant has more ownership of the circle than zero does.  It's fun to think of total reinvention, what one could do if one started all over:
