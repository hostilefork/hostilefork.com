[{I sat in on the talk.  I offered the Greek pronunciation of the Greek letter as a suitable name for the modified constant.  Children like to say it.
I vote for redefinining pi based on the space-time constants c and G when and if kids do light speed on a regular basis, sincerely.  Since they'll all have shuttles with the same turning radius, it'll make it physical for them and maintain the count of practical constants they need, too.
But check out the Wolfram math site <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hypersphere.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="liexternal">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hypersphere.html</a> - the second paragraph is an apology for the difference in terminology some physics and some math people stumbled over a while back.  If you have to draw the dot with the circle, is that exta geometrical object the same as a 2?
STEM ed, I think, uses dichotomies like this to move along students' understanding.  Hodson (in _Teaching and Learning about Science_, 2009 Sense Publishers, p. 289) calls it arguing to learn.  Which, he points out, requires you read his previous chapter about learning to argue, in the fashion of a scientist.
The urgency and importance of the distinctions between the two systems, that's what I think I'd benefit from having others learn.  You've actually got me in fits about that half-of-a-2pi factor in the Fourier transform now.  If America needs more of that, how does one transmit the caring part?  I don't model desirability well.}]
