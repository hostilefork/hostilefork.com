[{Hello thank-you for the extra information on this, it's much clearer now, especially with the new diagram. There's a lot of filtering going on there, so I was wondering why you couldn't just bandpass filter the original signal at different frequencies. I might look at some wavelet stuff, although I hear that aliasing is an issue, so it could end up very similar to your technique.}]

[{I found some C code by Jake Janovetz to do the remez coefficients, it seems to work O.K, but it does crash with certain values, did you use his code?}]

["Thanks again,"]
