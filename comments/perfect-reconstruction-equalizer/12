[{Hello again. I've built this EQ, but there is a problem. Being linear phase, the phase changes over time proportional to the amount of shift (size) of the filter. So when I upsample the half decimated signal, the phase slope is scaled. When the first band is added to the second band the phase differences cause a ' ^^^^V^^^^ ' like dip in the overlapping bands. The effect isn't easy to hear with high filter sizes as the overlap is quite small.}]
