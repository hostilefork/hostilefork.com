[{Why is it that, thinking about wave mechanics always leads me to go just a little bit more mad?
I still remember when my 6th-grade science teacher told us that the Sun emitted light at all frequencies equally (which theoretically requires infinite energy).  I think that's when I popped. Now I'm more careful in questioning Dirac's constant. 
My undestanding, last I looked at these issues, was that the more accurate a frequency manipulation you desired, the more latency needed to be introduced, the bane of live performance, and the irritant of synchronized-sound applications (A/V players).
I also understand that almost all software frequency analyzers and most hardware ones use various methods to cheat to make their tasks easier, figuring that no one will ever notice their lack of frequency response fidelity.}]
