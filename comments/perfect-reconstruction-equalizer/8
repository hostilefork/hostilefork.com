[{Please take note: It's been a long time since I did this.  Er, 12 years ago?  I was an undergraduate electrical engineer, and I haven't done much DSP since.  So I'd be surprised if someone didn't have a better idea of how to do it than what I came up with for a project, or if I was wrong about something!}]

[{The decreasing of array widths is a conceptual thing...and really the data can all be processed in place.  But to more clearly explicitly show what's happening and what all the bookkeeping needs to do, I tried to "pull it apart".  Here I'll badly hack up the "next step" if you want more than 3 bands in your EQ...and you'll see why I preferred to stop after 2 steps.  :)

So imagine that if you have a low pass Remez filter that basically passes everything below 2kHz, and you want to pass everything below 1kHz instead.  To get an equivalent to a low pass 1kHz Remez filter, just use the 2kHz design on the even samples, the odd samples, and then interleave them back together in time.  (The idea of taking a 4kHz Remez filter and dropping it to 1kHz by taking every 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sample... running the process...and then putting the samples back in their sequence post-filtering would be expected if this were true.)
This process is what I'm referring to as a "logarithmic drop".  I almost certainly can't prove myself today that process would give you another perfect reconstruction.  That must have been something I read or learned at the time, because I don't know how I'd have just taken that for granted unless the professor said I could!  Still--it would be very interesting to me if someone could recreate the effect (or debunk it).  Please let me know how it goes...
(P.S. I found an old C program that generates Remez filter coefficients if you don't have Matlab or something like that available.)}]
