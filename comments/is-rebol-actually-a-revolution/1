[{To all of you who constantly complain about (or against) proprietary software or framework, I just want to point a thing.
Like Hostilefork like to do (as with car engine), just look at some others things arround you.
What are you eating ? What is in your plates ? Where does the food you buy in the supermarket come from ?
Is your food "free" as the software you only believe in ?
I don't think so ! Ask the farmer. Many of them are doomed to the Monsanto world of contracts and layers (just to named it as M$ looks like to us), but it's probably not the only one.
But I believe there is proprietary companies that make good seeds, not GMO. And they sold them to farmer who knows that the earth is the plant food, and that the plant will feed it of products that another plant will eat next year. So no need to put thousand of chemicals to have it alive. If earth is good, plants are strong. Simple enough and definitly knows by our ancestors.}]

[{But in the inductrial era, the biggest plan (was it planned?) is to make all day simple things any people knew how to do by himself in the past, become assisted by apparatus of any kind (they can sold), so complex and sophisticated.}]

[{So yes, having washing machine is great things for what it does, but just count how much electrical appliances of all kind stand in your kitchen (do you have an electrical one to open canned?).
Big software companies marketing like to say that novelties (more complex by before) is better than past. So in the same time, they said that what they have done before was not good!
If Rebol Technologies is a proprietary company, for sure, it's a small one, and it is since the begining (even smaller today than 10 years ago). It will remain as is because it's his philosophy "Keep it simple, not simpler". There is no plan to make money (was Bill a good programmer? Hum bizness man for sure).}]

[{As Carl Sassenrath fight against software complexity, I could not believe he could let its company grows to an unmangeable big one. And even if its company failed (as that is the bigest fear of "free software" addicts) Rebol will be still available to us, maybe in a "free" and "open" way this time.
Just a last question "free" addicts : do you have an iPod, iPhone, Nike, KC underpants...???
To summarize : are you all so free?}]
