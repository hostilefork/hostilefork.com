[{@RSMilward: You are right, the red/blue was hard to read.  I switched to black and gray and it's much better.
As for changing the symbol for A... well, one issue is that I have sent a few Arecibo Ascii messages out into the ether by now.  And if I change the patterns then that means they won't decode.  Which wouldn't be the end of the world with this standard, especially since people can go down to the bits and judge for themselves what the letter is! 
But the font was not my design, it came from the PIC CPU:

I'm assuming they had a reason for putting the crossbar where they did.  In context it may help differentiate the A... I don't know (?)  It's certainly not the most questionable choice in the standard so far.
What I did do is I made an updated check in so that all the printable characters are now easy to edit in the source:

So if the idea entertains you enough to want to get involved in helping nail down the symbols for a "formal" release...I'll check the pull requests.  :) 
Thanks for the interest, in any case!}]
