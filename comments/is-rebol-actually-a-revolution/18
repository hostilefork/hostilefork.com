[{Quote away. re: web browsers and headaches, I hear you. However, the browser is pretty much the de-facto interface for the forseeable future. And with chrome, webkit, and competition, we may see support for more powerful and interesting applications in the future. 
I think the concept of a closed-source, ideologically pure RIA platform conceived primarily to live outside the browser is perhaps the antithesis of where the computing world is headed. To me, the road ahead looks multi-paradigm, multi-device, poly-language, and information-dense&#8211; neither simple nor pretty. Rebol is a unique and powerful tool. I hope it doesn't become a museum piece like the Antikythera mechanism.}]
