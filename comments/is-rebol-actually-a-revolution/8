["Problem I see with Rebol:-^/Scalability :-"]

[{One thing that I consistently see missing about Rebol is : How scalable is Rebol ?   Has anyone done any test?
Is it scalable and how fast is it?  again no answers.  
can the Rebol fans send their stats ?
The documentation is really pathetic.}]

[{One thing I don't get is that they brag about 3,000,000 downloads.  If they have that many people, how come there is barely anyone contributing to it. Is it 3,000, 000 downloads by 100 people who download daily to pump up their numbers ?}]
