[{@Bo But what about Tcl/Tk and J. Ousterhout? It's genius too: lang, tools, culture, COMMUNITY, author, ah? And background of Tcl culture looks very smart: high-quality small efficient code and high flexibility are main priorities too.

Rebol has 2 problems: 1) programmer community isn't ready for such ideology (and big business too, bcz of "large LOC, tools, apps => big money to IT"); 2) Rebol didn't found his niche: Javascript? :) Or general purpose? Where?
PS. Nobody can beat Javascript (ECMAScript), never try to fight with this language on traditional Javascript territory bcz almost programmers will use Javascript instead of any other language - it's a preference of peoples (good or bad, I don't know).
PPS. New Rebol rebirth Red looks that found it's niche.}]
