[{Antoine/Altis:
(Note for Antoine: Thanks for sending me the link.  I got confused and thought it was your blog, but apparently it is someone else's...just mentally mixed up Albert/Antoine when I clicked through.  Left a comment there.)
I've said repeatedly that where Rebol has most clearly failed is not an issue of technology so much as properly managing expectations.  A case of consistently terrible marketing, at almost every level.
But Rebol is Carl's "grand experiment" in language design.  It is driven mostly by his curiosity and not practical concerns.  That leaves a lot of people in the lurch because they encounter Rebol the way you might come to a language like Python or Ruby or C++... expecting a well-documented way of getting from point A to point B.
It's not that at all.  But it's tried to wear the costume, and it's clever enough to get people's hopes up.  Those hopes are quickly dashed when they interact with the self-selected community.  Some nice people, some less nice people, but everyone who's stuck with the language over the past decade is missing a lot of the energy, savvy, and charisma you'll find with Ruby on Rails or Python etc.
Yet as a project Rebol is profound and interesting.  So all the haters make me sad.  :-(  If Carl was in academia, and presented it as his evolving work that grad students were hacking on, I think it would be quite beloved.  But he's been in industry for a long time and sees the world through that lens, and I think he has made Rebol look like a "shrinkwrapped product" and it's... not.
What I wonder is&#8211;how can those who find the project interesting come together to support its unique ideas while giving meaningful feedback to steer it on course?  I've used Rebol enough to really like it and I'd like to be able to in good conscience suggest others use it... but there are some barriers to that right now.  Can we take the barriers down?

P.S. Yep, touting number of downloads is on par with having a hit counter on your site.  Very 90s.  You can get away with it these days if you're Firefox but most people can't.  Still.. rather than tear Rebol down can't we build it up?  If you use it you have to see the potential... so why not see the lousy marketing as something to improve?}]
