[{Programming infrastructure is, indeed, particularly insidious... you can't build large systems that rely on a proprietary language.  But a lot of people haven't "seen the light" on this.
Then again, there are many lights to be seen.  Ultimately, humanity will have to pull them all together.  It's a matter of priorities, which comes first.  So I don't hold it against anyone who needs to make money, but I feel like we need a "money exit strategy".  
I used to sometimes ask people who worked in stores how they would feel if everything in the store was free.  I wanted to know if they'd still come to work.  Rather than get resounding "Hell no" or "Yes, I love my job, it's not because of money"... they'd just look blankly and go "That couldn't work."
But people should think harder.  As in this video:
