[{@Bo: I'm not sure what part was directed at me or just the rhetorical "you"... but I'm glad you're having success with Rebol.
I am hopeful that larger success stories which speak to more people can come from the project.  But for now it seems the people who have stuck with it are some mixture of delusional and antisocial, and I don't need to make those aspects of myself any worse than they already are.  :) 
For myself, I count zero successes with the existing community.  That ranges from things like influencing <a href="http://www.Rebol.net/wiki/Rebol_logo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="liexternal">the graphic design</a> (where they're <i>clearly</i> bonkers), to not paying attention to my <a href="http://tryruby.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="liexternal">TryRuby</a> clone as an important idea for evangelism, to naming issues like "func" and "funct" and "q" and "/only".  It remains to be seen if with the host kit and mezzanine opening up if there will be a way for distributions to compete on their merits.
While Rebol is my overall favorite of interpreted languages I've seen so far, there are advantages to compiled systems with type-checking and all that jazz.  To have a more "All the crayons come in the box" experience in C++ you can standardize on something like the Qt toolkit.  The resulting experience feels comparably convenient, and you have a debugger as well!!}]
