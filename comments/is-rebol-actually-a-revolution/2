[{Hello DideC... Hostile Fork also likes to tell stories, here's one...  :) 
As a child, I used to wait anxiously from one Christmas or birthday to the next for a LEGO set.  This meant I only could have one or two a year, despite dreaming of LEGO cities.  Certainly my creativity was stifled by spending more time wishing than learning the lessons that come from building.
It was after seeing things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Construction_Set" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="liwikipedia">Pinball Construction Set</a> that I began to get the inkling that virtual LEGOs could be infinite!  I had the concept way before I'd ever seen anything like <a href="http://www.ldraw.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="liexternal">LDraw</a>, and to the best of my knowledge no such programs existed at that time for the C64.
Yet a virtual LEGO is not infinite by definition (e.g. constrained only by the resource limits of your available hardware.)  As we know with <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="liexternal">DRM</a>, it's possible to resurrect the familiar restrictions of matter into this new frontier.  Then we are kind of back where we started.
Can you see the child with a virtual LEGO set having to beg their parents--who might or might not have a lot of money--to buy them more virtual LEGOs?  I want the future to be guided by ethical principles that stop these situations from happening.
Also, I'd have liked to have written a LEGO CAD.  I had the built-in BASIC interpreter and a machine language monitor, which I dabbled in.  Little did I know most of the amazing C64 programs had been cross-compiled with proprietary assemblers and C compilers...no one told me, I was "just a kid"!  So I blamed myself for not being a good enough programmer.  Had I seen the source, I'd have realized how it was done--and I could have gotten started programming "for real" much earlier!
This is a piece of the historic lens through which I see this issue.  How we've done it before doesn't have to be the way we do it now.  Rebol is <i>mostly</i> "gratis", which is a nice change from when I grew up...and you can get it off the Internet, which didn't exist for my C64.  But the snowball is even bigger: programmers are now growing up with the expectation that if they receive something they can look at it to see how it works, improve it if they need to, and share it.
And to answer your question about can openers: I have a hand-operated one that I think is excellent.  It's actually one of my favorite designs...it cuts the lid of the can from the side, and has little pincers for picking off the lid built into it.  I wish I could email it to you, but I can only send a picture :)
