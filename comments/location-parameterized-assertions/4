[{Ah, although off the top of my head it seemed you could put a codeplace into a variable and then compare against the variable in multiple places... I now see that defeats the purpose.  It would indicate the location of the variable declaration and wouldn't live right next to the "interesting" line of code.
But bear in mind this article is out of date in terms of capturing my attempts to put identity-in-text...for reasons like that and others.  For my own projects, I've bitten the bullet and drop Base64 UUIDs all over my source, which some people might think is pointless but I find it very valuable.  The build process makes a table of them and what line numbers they are at off to the side.  Winds up looking more like:}]

[{Guess it's obvious that I do not care much for programming in text files!  I feel like if I can point to something on the screen with my finger I should have a way of expressing that "place" in my program.  I should be able to say "I mean that dot, there!" without having to say "the dot between phone and hangUp".  Of course, that requires a special kind of editor...one that recognizes the difference between moving that dot to another place and creating a new one...}]
