[{Totally tangential,
On the one hand, you’ve lost the fluidity to make changes—if the URL for this article had been <b>http://hostilefork.com/2008/10/20/96/</b> then I can fix typos without breaking links (what if I’d spelled "arecibo" wrong and wanted to fix it?)
WordPress maintains a list of previous URLs for an article so updating URLS don't break the old ones.
It's time for a WordPress upgrade - WP 2.7.1 tho we have 2.8 beta 2 too.
