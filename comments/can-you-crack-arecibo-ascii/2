[{Awesome work!
You lost me a little at "I think this is a good alternative to approaches like Gmail, where the organization running the servers have a sneaky advantage in being able to read & analyze your private data". Not sure I understand how Gmail relates. Are you just referring to gmail generally?
Isn't it the "protected parts of your text are never sent over the network" *unencrypted*. Unencrypted being an important part ;-)}]
