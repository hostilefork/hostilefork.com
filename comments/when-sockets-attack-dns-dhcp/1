[{Some history... For baby money, back when Skye was incubating, I used to teach a course on Microsoft's implementation of DHCP and DNS service (how they work and ways they are broken). DHCP is an evolution of improvement from the BOOTP protocol we used to use that handed out addresses from a MAC address look-up table.}]

["Today..."]

[{Many of the limitations introduced into the protocol by poor implementation of TCP/IP are being resolved these days by the protocol run on backbone networks. It allows us to run multiple (conflicting) TCP/IP networks over the same equipment by tagging or labeling (the L in MPLS) the networks as distinct. Quality of Service ( QoS ) elements are commercially available to companies that want it in their private networks.  (Net Neutrality)}]

[{The feature to support tags is a nice piece of future-proofing, that may serve it well into the future...}]
